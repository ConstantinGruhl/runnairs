# Enterprise AI Agent Platform — Local Prototype

A platform where admins govern, developers build, and end users run AI agents
with isolated execution, scoped secrets, audited tool calls, and human approvals.

This repository now includes the local prototype plus the first production-readiness hardening pass.
It is still not a finished production product, but the current stack is easier to launch, safer to
operate, and documented inside the product itself.

## Status

- [x] **Phase 0** — Scaffold (compose stack, health checks)
- [x] **Phase 1** — Auth + data model
- [x] **Phase 2** — Secret store
- [x] **Phase 3** — Agent SDK + tool gateway (LLM)
- [x] **Phase 4** — Execution backend (Docker)
- [x] **Phase 5** — Agent deploy + CLI
- [x] **Phase 6** — Catalog + run UI
- [x] **Phase 7** — Approvals
- [x] **Phase 8** — Remaining tools + sample agents
- [x] **Phase 9** — Feedback loop
- [x] **Phase 10** — Scheduling
- [x] **Phase 11** — Platform skill + tests
- [ ] **Phase 12** — README + demo script

## Quickstart (Phase 0)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Generate a Fernet key for PLATFORM_SECRETS_KEY (used in later phases):
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
# Paste the output into .env

docker compose up --build
```

Open the frontend at <http://localhost:3000>, sign in, and use the new **Docs** tab from the
sidebar in each role area for an in-app overview of purpose, usage, and security concepts.

When the stack is up:

| Service        | URL                     | Notes                          |
|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Frontend       | http://localhost:3000   | Admin, developer, user, and docs UI |
| Control plane  | http://localhost:8000   | `/health` returns `{ok: true}` |
| Tool gateway   | http://localhost:8001   | `/health` returns `{ok: true}` |
| Mock CRM       | http://localhost:8080   | `/customers`, `/health`        |
| MailHog UI     | http://localhost:8025   | Inbox for outgoing email       |
| Postgres       | localhost:5432          | Control plane DB               |
| Sample data DB | localhost:5433          | Demo CRM data                  |
| Redis          | localhost:6379          | Job queue                      |

`docker compose ps` should show all services healthy.

## Production baseline

Use the production overlay for the supported self-hosted baseline:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Important production notes:

- Set `APP_ENV=production`.
- Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` before startup. Production mode now rejects default or weak values.
- The frontend now talks to the backend through a same-origin proxy route, so browsers no longer
  need to resolve Docker-internal hostnames such as `control-plane`.
- See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) for the current operator guidance.
- See [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-11-production-readiness-master-plan.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-11-production-readiness-master-plan.md) for the broader roadmap covering first-run setup, IAM, skill distribution, and security hardening.

```

## Seeding

After `docker compose up`, seed the demo workspace:

```bash
./scripts/seed.sh
```

This creates one tenant ("Demo Workspace") and three users:

| Email              | Password     | Role      |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------|
| admin@demo.local   | demo-admin   | admin     |
| dev@demo.local     | demo-dev     | developer |
| user@demo.local    | demo-user    | user      |

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Workspace secrets

Workspace secrets are encrypted at rest with Fernet. The encryption key
comes from `PLATFORM_SECRETS_KEY` in `.env`. If unset, a deterministic
dev key is derived from `JWT_SECRET` (loud warning logged) — fine for
local play, never for anything real.

Generate a real key with:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Admin UI at <http://localhost:3000/admin/secrets> after signing in as
`admin@demo.local`.

## Agent SDK + tool gateway

The platform has a working `tools.llm.complete` end-to-end:

```bash
./scripts/build-agent-runtime.sh   # one-time, builds platform/agent-runtime:latest
./scripts/test-phase3.sh           # mints a run token, calls the SDK, prints the audit row
```

Without `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured for the tenant, the gateway falls
back to a deterministic stub backend (the demo runs without keys). With
a key configured via the admin secrets UI, the gateway calls OpenAI for
real and reports actual token usage and cost.

## Run lifecycle (hello-world end-to-end)

```bash
./scripts/build-agent-runtime.sh   # base image with platform_sdk
./scripts/build-hello-world.sh     # examples/hello-world image
./scripts/seed.sh                  # tenant + users + hello-world Agent row

# Trigger a run (any logged-in user):
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/runs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_slug":"hello-world","inputs":{"greeting":"Hi"}}'

# Poll status:
curl http://localhost:8000/runs/<run_id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Each run boots a fresh container with the platform's invariants in
place: read-only root, tmpfs at `/tmp`, no privileged, all caps
dropped, mem/cpu limits from the manifest, attached only to the
internal `agent-egress` network so the tool gateway is the only peer
the agent can reach. Verified: external HTTPS and DNS lookups from
inside an agent container fail; `tool-gateway:8001/health` works.

## Developer CLI

```bash
pip install -e packages/platform_cli
platform-cli login --email dev@demo.local --api-url http://localhost:8000
platform-cli init my-agent
# edit my-agent/automation.yaml + my-agent/main.py
platform-cli deploy ./my-agent
```

`platform-cli init` now creates a native automation starter with
`automation.yaml`, `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and `tests/test_agent.py`.
Use `agent.yaml` only when maintaining an older compatibility package.

`deploy` zips the directory, uploads to `POST /dev/agents/deploy`, and the
control plane validates the manifest, builds an image tagged
`agent-<uuid>:v<n>` from `platform/agent-runtime` + the agent code, and
creates a draft `AgentVersion` row. Admins approve it via
`POST /admin/agents/<slug>/approve` (UI lands in Phase 6) before end
users can run it.

## Approvals + email

`weekly-summary` now demonstrates the full pause-and-approve loop:

1. End user runs the agent.
2. After the LLM summary, the agent calls `ctx.request_approval(action="email.send", ...)`.
3. Run status flips to `awaiting_approval`. The run detail page shows
   the pending approval inline.
4. An admin clicks Approve (or hits `POST /admin/approvals/{id}/decide`).
5. The agent's long-poll returns, the agent calls `tools.email.send`,
   which the gateway accepts because there's now an approved approval
   for the `email.send` action.
6. Email lands in MailHog at <http://localhost:8025>.

If denied (or timed out), the agent returns without calling
`email.send`. If the agent tries to call an approval-gated tool
without an approved approval, the gateway returns 403.

## Sample agents

`scripts/build-examples.sh` builds all four images
(`hello-world`, `weekly-summary`, `inbox-triage`, `customer-briefing`).
Deploy them with `platform-cli deploy ./examples/<slug>`. The seed
script ships only the `hello-world` row; the rest land via deploy.

| Agent | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| weekly-summary | postgres.query + llm + approval + email |
| inbox-triage | inbox.list (gateway-side mock) + user-scope MAILBOX_TOKEN gating |
| customer-briefing | postgres + http with `permissions.http_allowlist` against the mock CRM |

Connect a user-scope secret from the catalog page: open an agent that
declares one (e.g. `inbox-triage`), click Connect under the new
**Connect your accounts** card, paste a token. Run history shows the
explicit failure mode if a user runs without connecting first.

## Tests + the platform skill

Two layers:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

- **Agent unit tests** under `examples/<slug>/tests/test_agent.py` use
  `platform_sdk.testing.MockGateway` to stub every gateway call. They
  run in milliseconds, no compose required.
- **Integration test** at `tests/integration/test_happy_path.py` walks
  the §16 demo flow against a running compose stack: `weekly-summary`
  → `awaiting_approval` → admin approves → email lands in MailHog →
  feedback flows to the dev dashboard. Plus `inbox-triage` failing
  cleanly without a connected `MAILBOX_TOKEN`.

The canonical agent-author guide is
[skills/platform-agent/SKILL.md](skills/platform-agent/SKILL.md). It
ships into each `examples/<slug>/.claude/skills/platform-agent/` so
Claude Code loads it automatically when invoked inside an agent
directory. `scripts/sync-agent-skill.sh` re-syncs after edits.

Focused verification commands used for the current hardening pass:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run build
PYTHONPATH="services/control-plane:packages/platform_sdk:packages/platform_cli" pytest tests/unit/test_schedule_service.py -q
```

On Windows PowerShell, set `$env:PYTHONPATH="services/control-plane;packages/platform_sdk;packages/platform_cli"` before running the pytest command.

## Known limitations

- Anthropic + other LLM providers can be plugged into the gateway
  alongside OpenAI; only OpenAI is wired today.
- Local-storage browser tokens remain in use today; a production auth/session redesign is still planned.
- The first-run configure mode, pluggable IAM, Git-backed skill distribution, and full production security program are planned next rather than finished today.
